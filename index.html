							<h3>Predicting Trip Purpose Using Machine Learning</h2>
							<!-- <p>
								I used California Transport data to predict the purpose of a person's trip given spatial, temporal, and personal
								features (income, education, etc.). I learned different ways to visualize the data set in order to first gain insights
								and fix errors in a dataset with over 42,000 rows and 50 features (columns). In order to used recursive feature selection
								to find the best features for prediction and remove features that were not good predictors. 
								I found the best standard models for prediction (Gradient Boosting Tree and Random Forest Classifier) and used recursive 
								feature selection optimize the base models further by only including features that served as good predictors. 
								Finally, I built my own predictive model, that outperformed the best of these standard models by 4%

							<p>
								I used California Transport data to predict the purpose of a users's trip given her starting location, time, and certain personal
								features (income, education, etc.). I created a novel predictive model, that surpassed the predictive accuracy of previous models by 4%
								by weighting long-term vs. short-term behavior.
